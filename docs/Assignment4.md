# Assignment 4 - React Table

- Start via `docker compose up --build -d`

## Tasks

- [ ] start react project
- [ ] throw away any files we dont need for this small demo
- [ ] configure front end to look pretty for demo - add styling and meta tags such as title and favicon
- [ ] install packages (mui, virtualized, axios?)
- [ ] choose a couple example mui tables to combine into one
- [ ]

## Optimizations to try

- [ ] show off some react skills? context, etc? - this seems too small to require something like that. perhaps just localstorage caching?
- [ ] react testing

## Notes

- This one was the easiest and I needed a break from python so I worked on this one a bit after assignment 2 before working on assignment 3
- react isn't inherently difficult for me, so I didn't see the point in spending too much time on this one. I decided to spend my effort in the python code and actually make that look good.
